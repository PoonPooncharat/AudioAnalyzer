# Audio Analyzer
  An audio analyzer is made for testing and measuring performance of the sound audio. Audio analysis requires Spectral Analysis that can be frequency spectrum by using Fourier transform.
## Introduction
  This project is prepared in partial fulfillment of the requirements for 010123106 the Intro to Signals and Systems which is a part of the computer engineering curriculum in King Mongkut’s University of Technology North Bangkok —KMUTNB— Thailand.

# Overview
  There are 3 graphs on display: Time-Domain, Merge and Frequency Spectrum. Users can select the tab to see what graph they want to see. Users can Set the sound wave that they like too.
## How to use
  Users can import audio sound by press add button and can export audio file by export button. When users are importing audio files already, they can use merge to compile it together. The display will have 3 tabs that users can select what they want to see: Time-Domain, Merge and Frequency Spectrum.  
  - Time-Domain : Show graph that reads audio file from the directory.
  - Merge : Show graph that users compile.
  - Frequency Spectrum : Show graph frequency spectrum of the combined audio signal
## Features
  - Reverse : Reverse your audio files and make them play backwards.
  - Inverse :  flips the audio samples upside-down or which mean reversing their polarity.
  - Normalize : If the audio file doesn't have amplitude reach 1 or less than that, It’ll increase until amplitude up to 1. 
  - Speed : This function can increase or decrease speed of audio file’s users import.
  - Amplitude : To gain audio amplitude how loud the audio file.
  - Trim : Users can choose part of the audio file to cut it.
